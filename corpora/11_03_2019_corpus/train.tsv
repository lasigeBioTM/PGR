30569945	BACKGROUND Epigenetic modifications in host cells, like p16 ink4a methylation, have been considered as putative complementary mechanisms for cancer development.	ink4a	cancer	1029	HP_0002664	60	65	141	147	True
30569945	OBJECTIVES We hypothesised that p16 ink4a methylation might have a role in cancer development driven by HPV16, mainly in the presence of intact E1/E2 genes.	ink4a	cancer	1029	HP_0002664	36	41	75	81	True
30569945	Methylation status of the p16 ink4a promoter was assessed by methylation-specific PCR in 87 cervical specimens comprising 29 low-grade (LSIL), 41 high-grade (HSIL) lesions, and 17 cervical cancers (CC).	ink4a	cancer	1029	HP_0002664	30	35	189	195	True

21746835	For example, the cerebellar malformations observed in RIKEN 4930444A02 knockout mice show similarities to a number of developmental disorders, such as Joubert, Meckel-Gruber, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes, which involve mutations in cilia-related genes.	mice	cerebellar malformations	23581	HP_0002438	80	84	17	41	False
21746835	Even though the direct relevance of mouse models to hydrocephalus in humans remains uncertain, the high prevalence of familial patterns of inheritance for congenital hydrocephalus in humans suggests that identification of genes responsible for development of hydrocephalus in mice may lead to the identification of homologous modifier genes and susceptibility alleles in humans.	mice	hydrocephalus	23581	HP_0000238	276	280	52	65	False
